# Rok
A wild lisp for wild hackers

Worked through www.buildyourownlisp.com to learn about how programming languages work and are born while learning C and LISP at the same time


# Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `make rok` in the root of the repo.
2a. Feel free to add the `rok` binary to your PATH or create a symlink to run it without the dot.
3. Run `rok` to open the REPL
4. Run `rok <filename>` to run a `.rok` script


# Your First Rok Script
1. Create a file called `mu.rok`
2. Write in it: `(print "Hello World!")`
3. Run `rok mu.rok`
4. Be amazed as your message is printed!
5. Or do all that within the REPL (`rok`). My way is cooler though.
